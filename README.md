This lab assignment is a further step based on the UNIX shell interface and implement adding history to UNIX shell. The history feature allows users to access up to ten most recently entered commands. These commands will be numbered starting at 1 and will continue to grow larger even past 10 (e.g., if the user has entered 35 commands, the ten most recent commands should be numbered 26 to 35).
A user will be able to list ten most recently entered commands upon pressing <Control>-<C>, which sends the SIGINT signal to the shell process via the OS kernel. UNIX systems use signals to notify a process that a particular event has occurred. Signals may be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the source and the reason for the event being signaled. Once a signal has been generated by the occurrence of a certain event (e.g., division by zero, illegal memory access, user entering <Control>-<C>, etc.), the signal is delivered to a process where it must be handled. After receiving a signal, a process may handle it by one of the following techniques:
